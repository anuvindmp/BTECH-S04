### Slide 13: Design Specification of a 4-DOF SCARA


"Now, let's move on to the design specification of the 4-DOF SCARA robot. The configuration includes three revolute joints (3R) and one prismatic joint (1P), allowing for precise horizontal movements and vertical positioning. This setup makes it ideal for industrial automation. The design focuses on high-speed operation, accuracy, and ease of programming, ensuring efficient and reliable performance in applications such as assembly, packaging, and material handling."


The robot features a robust yet lightweight frame constructed from high-strength aluminum alloys, providing durability and stability while minimizing weight. 
It includes three revolute joints for rotational movements around the base, shoulder, and elbow, allowing a wide range of motion in the horizontal plane. The prismatic joint enables precise vertical adjustments, essential for accurate pick-and-place operations. 
The arm segments are designed to balance strength and reach, while the base is firmly anchored to ensure stability during high-speed operations. Integrated cabling and compact actuators reduce interference and enhance operational efficiency.

Slide 14: Design Specification - Components

"The components of our design include actuators and motors, preferably stepper or servo motors. These can be placed directly at each joint or remotely with belts and pulleys. The control system is managed by a microcontroller or PLC, featuring a user-friendly programming interface. A feedback system, using encoders, ensures precise positioning. Additionally, various sensors such as rotary encoders or potentiometers for position, force sensors at the end effector, and proximity sensors for collision avoidance enhance precision and safety."
