 live demonstration of our SCARA robot simulation using RoboDK. This simulation allows us to visualize and validate the robot's movements in a virtual environment before implementing them in real-world applications. 

here we can see the  simulation environment in RoboDK. Here, we can see a virtual representation of our SCARA robot, complete with its workspace and tools

To begin, let's observe how the SCARA robot moves in this virtual space. We'll demonstrate both joint movements, which control its configuration, and Cartesian movements, defining precise positions in XYZ coordinates.
