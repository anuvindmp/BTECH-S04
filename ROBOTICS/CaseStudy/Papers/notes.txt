4DoF scara : pick and place robotic manipulator for industry assembly line.

=> main concerns in existing robotic manipulators : 
	1. lack of precision and control (normal 4DoF manipulators)
	2. smaller workspace (within scara)
	 -> even if workspace is large, higher inertia prevents faster movements

Major application : 
-> in agricultural field
